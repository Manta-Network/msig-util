# TypeScript NodeJS Boilerplate

This repository is a "ready-to-hack" TypeScript boilerplate project that is set
up with common tools that I find useful when creating applications with NodeJS.

## Includes

- AVA for testing.
- Commander for CLI parsing.
- Eslint for code consistency.
- Prettier for code formatting.
- Winston for logging.

## How to use

```zsh
$ git clone git@github.com:lsaether/ts-boilerplate.git
$ mv ts-boilerplate my-project
$ cd my-project ; yarn
```
